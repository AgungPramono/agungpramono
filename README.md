## 🚀 About Me

My journey in coding started with learning **C** and **C++**, where I built a strong foundation in programming fundamentals.  
I then moved to **Java** ☕, diving deep into the challenging and powerful concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, which shaped my approach to writing clean and maintainable code.  
From there, I explored **Golang** 🐹 and **JavaScript** ✨ to build efficient and scalable applications.  

Alongside, I developed a keen interest in **Data Mining** and **Machine Learning** algorithms, especially using **Python** 🐍 and its rich ecosystem of libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
